# Your task is to make two functions (max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language) that receive a list of integers as input and return, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that list.

# Examples (Input -> Output)
# * [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
# * [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
# * [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
# * [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5

# def minimum(arr):
#     i=0
#     while i<len(arr):
#         a=min(arr)
#         i+=1
#     return a
# def maximum(arr):
#     j=0
#     while j<len(arr):
#         b=max(arr)
#         j+=1
#     return

# Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

# For example:

# a = 1
# b = 4
# --> [1, 2, 3, 4]

# def between(a,b):
#     i=a
#     c=[]
#     while i<=b:
#         x=i
#         c.append(x)
#         i+=1
#     return c
#     pass

# Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.
